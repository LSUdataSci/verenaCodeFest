## Welcome to the Verena codeFest!!

This is the first codeFest as part of a funded effort from the LSU College of Science and the Department of Biological Sciences, so a big "thank you" to them for helping us put this on. More information about future events is available at https://lsudatasci.github.io/. We will alternate codeFests and makerSpaces, and these events will take place the first Friday of every month. codeFests are designed to get folks across the College of Science working on computational approaches to handling and analyzing data. makerSpaces are meant to teach both hardware and software, as projects will work with microcomputers to build neat projects and then use code to make them _come alive_ (e.g., an LED matrix which scrolls a pre-defined message). 





### The challenge

This month, the challenge is to break up into teams to attack some data on host-virus interactions. The challenge is open-ended, and more information on potential project ideas can be found in the `dataExplore.Rmd` document that we'll go over. Ideally, groups of 3-6 folks will form, with at least 1 or 2 students feeling moderately comfortable working with some statistical programming language. If not, **no worries**. This is a learning opportunity. 









### The data

**Virome, in One Network (VIRION) is an open atlas of the vertebrate virome**

> The VIRION database was built by, and is curated by, an interdisciplinary team of virologists, ecologists, and data scientists as part of the [Verena Consortium](https://www.viralemergence.org/), an effort to predict which viruses could infect humans, which animals host them, and where they could someday emerge.

> VIRION is the most comprehensive database of its kind, drawing data from scientific literature and online databases, and is updated automatically with new data. Today, it includes over 2.8 million interactions that capture roughly 25% of known mammal diversity, 10% of bird diversity, and 6% of total vertebrate diversity. Unlike many other databases, VIRION has undergone a taxonomic reconciliaton process using a backbone provided by [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi), with a total (at last count) of 3,787 valid vertebrate host species and 9,003 valid viruses, of which 1,658 are ICTV-ratified valid names. 







### The prizes

There will be prizes for the top three projects, as assessed by a panel of judges. 







### The code of conduct

We use the Contributor Covenant as a code of conduct (`codeOfConduct.md` file in this repo). Violations of this code will result in immediate action. And remember, while this is not a class, you are still at LSU and subject to the [LSU code of conduct](https://www.lsu.edu/saa/students/codeofconduct.php), though we have recently seen how that has sometimes failed to be enforced to the benefit and safety of students at LSU (e.g., [title IX mishandlings](https://www.lsu.edu/titleix-review/))

We acknowledge funding from Louisiana State University that made this event possible.
